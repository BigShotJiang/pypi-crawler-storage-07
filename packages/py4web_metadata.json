They collectively agree to release the code under the BSD license show below. Whoever contributes code to py4web implicitly agrees to the BSD license. When developers contribute a significant part of code that has applications independent of py4web they are also free to release such code separately under different additional licenses, as long as this does not conflict with the BSD license. If code is copied from a third party source, it is the responsibility of the developer to make sure that it is compatible with the BSD license and to include the proper attribution. If code is developed under a sponsorship agreement or other paid agreement with a third party, this must also be disclosed in a comment within the code. The py4web trademarks are not released under the BSD license but are regulated by the \"py4web trademark policy\" also shown below.\n        \n        BSD License\n        ===========\n        \n        Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n        \n        1.
